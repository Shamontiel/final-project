            <h1 class="heading-font">About Junee</h1>
            <p>Shamontiel is a three-time dog owner (one Lab crossbreed for 13 years; one German Shepherd for 9 years; and now the owner of a Hound mix). Dog walking and dog boarding weren't career fields she intended to get into. She did it initially because her own condo board wouldn't allow dogs, and she missed having a four-legged roommate. By the time she challenged the condo association board to do away with the no-pet rule, she accepted the nomination of being the condo association president and became a dog caregiver. The Wag! walker and former Rover dog boarder completed 523 walks, eight dog sittings and six dog boardings for 93 different dogs since 2019. On Juneteenth 2021, when COVID-19 hit and dog caregiving slowed down, she adopted a dog: Junee.</p>
            <h1>Shamontiel's Hound Mix</h1>
            <p>Wow! Junee is 2 years old. Time flies by when you're having fun—with a 33-pound dog who flops on your chest and stares at you to make sure you're breathing through morning meditation. (My ribs must be getting stronger every day.)
        
                I adopted this Hound mix when she was 4 months old. I originally looked at super small puppies and said, "I don't want a dog who feels too big for my condo." But I just kept clicking on the photo of this then-puppy over and over and over again.</p>
